What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git starts to recoganize it as directiory for your project and loads the
	.git file into it. Its needed so that we can add/track files in our project
	and perform various other functions of Git. Basically its the intial step
	towards using the Git features in our projects.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	Files in staging area are tracked by the git while in the working directory
	they are not. Staged files can be added to the repository or even removed
	from the staged area.It allows us to make sure that the commits are made 
	logically than randomly to the main repository, that is whenever there is 
	logical changes in the staged files.

change?
